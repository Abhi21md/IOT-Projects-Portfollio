# Fingerprint-Based Authentication Module

Standalone biometric authentication system using Arduino
and optical fingerprint sensor.

---

## Overview

This project provides secure fingerprint-based access control.
It works independently without internet connectivity.

---

## Features

• Biometric authentication
• LCD status display
• Relay-based output control
• Access granted / denied indication
• Standalone embedded system

---

## Hardware Used

- Arduino UNO / Nano
- R307 / R305 / AS608 Fingerprint Sensor
- 16x2 I2C LCD
- Relay Module
- Buzzer

## Working Principle

1. User places finger on sensor.
2. System matches fingerprint with stored templates.
3. If match found:
   → Relay activates
   → Access granted
4. If no match:
   → Access denied
