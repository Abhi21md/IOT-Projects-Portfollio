# 🚦 Density Based Traffic Control System

An intelligent traffic signal management system
using ultrasonic sensors to detect vehicle density.

---

## Features

• Real-time density detection
• 4-road intersection control
• Dynamic green signal allocation
• Yellow transition safety delay
• Fully automated operation
• Serial debugging support

---

## Technology Used

• ESP32 Microcontroller
• 4 × HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors
• 12 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
• Distance comparison algorithm

---

## Working Logic

Minimum Distance = Highest Vehicle Density

If vehicle detected within threshold:
→ That road gets green signal.

Else:
→ All signals remain red.

---

## Applications

• Smart City Traffic Systems
• Adaptive Traffic Control
• IoT Traffic Monitoring
• Urban Intersection Automation
