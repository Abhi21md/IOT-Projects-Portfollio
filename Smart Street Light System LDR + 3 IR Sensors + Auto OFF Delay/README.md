# Smart Street Light System with Motion Detection

## Overview

This project is an energy-efficient automatic street lighting system built using Arduino UNO, LDR, and IR motion sensors.

The system turns ON street lamps only at night and only when motion is detected.

## Key Features

• Automatic day/night detection  
• Motion-based lighting  
• Auto turn-off delay  
• Energy saving design  
• Serial debugging support  
• Scalable for smart city implementation

## Components Used

- Arduino UNO
- LDR sensor
- 3 IR sensors
- 3 LEDs / Relay modules
- Resistors
- Power supply

---

## How It Works

1. LDR detects ambient light.
2. If dark → system activates motion monitoring.
3. If IR detects motion → corresponding lamp turns ON.
4. Lamp turns OFF automatically after delay.
5. During daytime → all lamps remain OFF.
