SYSTEM OVERVIEW
----------------

This project monitors soil moisture, temperature,
and humidity of a plant environment.

The system automatically controls water pump
based on soil dryness level.

WORKING PRINCIPLE:

1. Soil sensor reads moisture percentage.
2. If soil < threshold → Pump turns ON.
3. If soil ≥ threshold → Pump turns OFF.
4. DHT11 reads temperature and humidity.
5. If temperature exceeds set limit → Buzzer alert.
6. LCD continuously displays real-time data.

FEATURES:

• Automatic irrigation control
• Real-time temperature monitoring
• Humidity tracking
• Dry soil detection
• Over-temperature alert
• LCD display interface
• Serial debugging support
