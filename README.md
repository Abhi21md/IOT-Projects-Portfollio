## Working Principle

1. Sensors collect real-time input data.
2. The microcontroller processes and evaluates the data.
3. Embedded logic determines system actions.
4. Actuators are triggered based on programmed conditions.
5. Data may be displayed locally and optionally transmitted to a cloud platform.
6. Alerts are generated during abnormal or critical conditions.
