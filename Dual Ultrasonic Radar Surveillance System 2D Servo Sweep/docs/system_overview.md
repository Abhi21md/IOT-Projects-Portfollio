The Dual Ultrasonic Radar System simulates a security radar mechanism.

It uses:
- Two ultrasonic sensors for left and right detection
- Dual servo motors for radar sweeping
- LED beams for side indication
- Buzzer for alert

The system locks position when object is detected and resumes sweep once object leaves the detection range.
